20131101 (T.S.):
 - added saio.c, saio.h (wrappers for linux' AIO syscalls)
 - made si5326_setup(int fd, Si5326Parms p) public
 - added sis8300DigiGetADC_ID(int fd)
 - added sis8300DigiGetFclkMax(int fd)
 - sis8300DigiSetup(): initially set MUX to internal clock and
   AD9510 to divide by 32; check whether the max. clock of the
   ADC is compatible with the requested clock frequency and
   reject if necessary. Program the final mux. and 9510 settings
   only if frequency check passes.
